This is a fairly simple transaction system, built around the concept of 'virtual shares'.
In practice, these can also stand for real shares or actual cash transactions.
In this prototype, the trasaction ecosystem is contained within a single class, and operations are carried out by instances of the VirtualShares class.

A couple of images have been added, categorized into Test 1, Test 2, and Test 3. These images illustrate transaction operations.
Test 3 shows how invalid or erroneous operations are handled by the system.
For most things, the images will be enough to show how the system works.

However, a code snippet from the original Python file has been added to show the code quality for software/code-oriented viewers.
